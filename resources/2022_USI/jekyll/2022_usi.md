## About the Presentation ##
Myriad approaches exist to help humans peer inside automated decision-making
systems based on artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms.
These tools and the insights they produce, however, tend to be complex
socio-technological constructs themselves, hence subject to technical
limitations as well as human biases and (possibly ill-defined) preferences.
Under these conditions, how can we ensure that explanations are meaningful and
fulfil their role by leading to understanding?

In this talk I will provide a high-level introduction to and overview of
explainable AI and interpretable ML, followed by a deep dive into practical
aspects of a popular explainability algorithm.
I will demonstrate how different configurations of an explainer -- that is
often presented as a monolithic, end-to-end tool -- may impact the resulting
insights.
I will then show the importance of the strategy employed to present them
to a user, arguing in favour of a clear separation between the technical and
social aspects of such techniques.
Importantly, understanding these dependencies can help us to build bespoke
explainers that are robust, reliable, trustworthy and suitable for the unique
problem at hand.

## FAT Forensics (Software) ##
To support the goals of this presentation, we employ
[`FAT Forensics`](https://fat-forensics.org/) -- an open source Python package
that can inspect selected fairness, accountability and **transparency** aspects
of data (and their features), *models* and *predictions*.
The toolbox spans all of the FAT domains because many of them share underlying
algorithmic components that can be reused in multiple different
implementations, often across the FAT borders.
This *interoperability* allows, for example, a counterfactual data point
generator to be used as a post-hoc explainer of black-box predictions on
one hand, and as an individual fairness (disparate treatment) inspection tool
on the other.
The *modular* architecture[^1][^2] enables
[`FAT Forensics`](https://fat-forensics.org/) to deliver robust and tested
low-level FAT building blocks as well as a collection of FAT tools built on top
of them.
Users can choose from these ready-made tools or, alternatively, combine the
available building blocks to create their own bespoke algorithms without the
need of modifying the code base.

## Resources ##
The [presentation]({{ page.slides }}) is provided as an interactive set of
slides utilising iPyWidgets and built with a Jupyter Notebook based on
[RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/) and [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/).
This notebook (hence the presentation) can be executed locally on one's own
machine or launched directly in the web browser through Google Colab or
MyBidner.
