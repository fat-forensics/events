# Practical Machine Learning Explainability #
## Surrogate Explainers and Fairwashing ##

> *A 2021 Bristol Interactive AI Summer School (BIAS) session with a hands-on component.*

This directory holds a collection of training materials on building and
configuring bespoke surrogate explainers of individual black-box
predictions for tabular data.
Understanding the technical lineage of surrogate explanations allows us
to manipulate their parameterisation to generate deceptive insights.
The following resources are available:

* Hands-on Resources (Jupyter Notebooks) --
  [this](https://github.com/fat-forensics/resources/tree/master/tabular_surrogate_builder)
  repository.
* Presentation Slides -- [slides](slides) directory.

See <https://events.fat-forensics.org/2021_bias> for more details.
